    <h2><b>Get to know me</b></h1>
      <p style="background-color:white;">Welcome to my first blog, also my first html
      <br>page. I am a young student. Still in high school, learning how to code my own website for web design.
    <br>Pretty fun right. So I have two differnt sides to me. One side that likes to get my nails and hair done and the other side
  likes to get muddy and ride quads and spend all day outside. <br>I like to hang with the guys.
  <br>I have two brothers and one sister. My parents are divorced. Whenever I'm at my dads
  <br>house its all boys and me the only girl in the house. So we tipically do boy stuff,
  <br>which probably why I enjoy watching football and playing sports and getting muddy.
