    <h1><b>My Hobby</b></h1>
      <p style="color: black;"<p>My favorite hobby is riding four wheelers. When I'm at my dads house I'm
    <br> the only girl so we tend to do a lot of boy stuff, which I dont mind doing.
      <br>I'm kind of a tom boy. My dad has always been into riding and recently he
      <br>got my younger brother Gavin into riding dirtbikes. So we go out to the track
      <br>almost every weekend we are at his house.I enjoy riding four wheelers
      <br>but my dad said he is going to have to teach me how to ride a dirt bike
      <br>soon after my brother gets the hang of it. If he teaches me now my brother
      <br> will be mad because I learn faster than he does.</p>

    <h2>My Hobby</h2>
      <p style="color: black;"<p>My dad said that I will have to figure out what I like better
        <br>a dirt bike or a four wheeler. They both have there advantages.
        <br>My dads friend, Jimmy is the owner of a track called Route 62, which we go to
        <br>often. Jimmy's has a son who is aslo my brothers best friend and he has an
        <br>older brother. Which makes it more fun to go to the track and have people to talk to.
        <br>Every dirtbike race that they have they have to have a starter girl that counts
        <br>people down. One time I was the starter girl for the whole day which was
         <br>pretty fun.</p>
